ListIt System

The ListIt System source code should be run from the Main class in its current form. The Main class
provides a menu which exercises the functionality of ListIt. The current ListIt system allows
buyers and sellers to login, create user accounts, browse item listings, create item listings, and
logout. The ListIt application reads in user account and item listing data into the application
in a concurrent manner to display a console menu to users. The ListIt System maintains a database
of user account and item listing information to allow for long-term, durable storage.
